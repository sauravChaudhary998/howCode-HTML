      Justin Beaver just confessed something that even his greatest
      fans would never have expected of the skilled musician and lyricist.
      The young rock-and-roller admitted that since he typed his first
      title tag, his life became easier. It has been reported by those
      surrounding the Canadian that Beaver's private mentors, Ryan Loseling
      and Nicholas Crate, often walk around Los Angeles disputing what a great
      tool the HTML validator is.

      Beaver has already created some websites and does not intend to stop there.
